    "\n",
    "Different software packages implements these steps to analyze fMRI data. So, in theory, it is possible to mix different steps from different software tools but you can still implement all the necessary steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why nipype?\n",
    "\n",
    "Different fMRI analysis software tools have their own scripting capability. In other words, each package lets you write a script (a series of instructions) to implement the entire analysis pipeline from the beginning to the end. This is useful especially you have to run the same pre-processing and analysis steps for multiple subjects. Analyzing multiple subjects' data using a GUI will increase the risk of human error (clicking a wrong button, selecting a wrong file, entering wrong parameters, etc.). \n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax to script a processing pipeline is different in different packages. For a starter, in SPM you write a script in MATLAB, whereas in FSL, you need to code in a shell script. **Nipype** enables you to script different steps in different software tools in Python, so that mixing of different steps very easy.\n",

    "Here is an example of how `nipype` implements different steps. The diagram such as this one represents a **workflow**, a series of tasks organized into a diagram, with output from one task fed into the following task. Here, each task is represented as a **node**. A node may take a certain input(s) and produces an output. "

    "As you can imagine, everybody's head has a different shape, thus everybody's brain is different. Consequently, comparing brains from multiple people can be challenging. One solution is to *warp* everybody's brain into the standard shape brain (often referred as the **template**) so that we can compare brains across subjects.\n",

    "### Native and template spaces\n",

The Talairach atlas is defined based on a single post-mortem brain. Today, the MNI (Montreal Neurological Institute) template is most widely used. The MNI template is the average of 152 high resolution brain images (of young adults) warped with high-dimensional transformation to a common space. "

    "\n",
    "### Linear registration\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of linear registration is to roughly match a subject's brain with the template brain. A linear registration consists of 4 different types of mathematical operations (translation, rotation, scaling, and shear) in 3 different directions (x-, y-, and z-directions). These transformations are often referred as the **affine transformation**. In total, there are 12 possible operations in an affine transformation, it can be described in a 3x4 matrix, known as an *affine matrix*.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A linear registration is applied to the entire image, without any local refinement.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Non-linear registration\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of non-linear registration is to warp an image locally to match the template as much as possible. Since non-linear registration is performed locally, a very large number of parameters are needed to describe such a transformation. A sophisticate non-linear registration algorithm requires significant computational resources (like, a super-computer) and hours of calculation. Algorithms used by fMRI analysis packages are much less sophisticated, and can be run on a decent work station in 30 min or less. However, even such simple algorithms require thousands of parameters.\n",
