    "The first-level analysis refers to a statistical analysis of fMRI data on a single subject (of a single session and/or a single run). The main goal in the first-level analysis is to fit a temporal model to the fMRI data to quantify the activation of interest as contrast(s). \n",

    "## Predicted BOLD signals\n",

    "In this experiment, you anticipate activations associated with the stimulus, and you try to capture that with BOLD (blood oxygenation-level dependent) fMRI. However, after a neural activity, you can only observe delayed response in the resultant BOLD signal due to a hemodynamic delay. Such a delay is modeled by a function known as a **hemodynamic response function (HRF)**. The predicted BOLD signal, from an fMRI experiment, is the underlying neural activity convolved by an HRF.\n",
