    "## Instructor\n",
    "\n",
    "**Satoru Hayasaka**\n",
    "  * **Office**: SEA 2.214\n",
    "  * **Email**: hayasaka@utexas.edu\n",
    "  * **Office hours**: 10:00-11:30am, Mon & Fri - Or by appointment\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "## What this course is about\n",
    "\n",
    "***In this course, you will learn more than how to press buttons on a particular analysis software tool.*** Instead, there will be lots of coding! It is becoming more common among neuroimaging researchers to code and construct their own pipeline to meet their particular data analysis needs. You will also learn concepts associated with various steps of preprocessing and analyses. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Required tools\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hardware\n",
    "#### Computer\n",
    "You will need a computer that can handle a typical fMRI study data for preprocessing and data analysis. I recommend a system with at least 4GB of RAM per CPU core.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **If your lab has a computer for fMRI data processing**:\n",
    "    * Great! You should remote-login to that computer via your laptop or an iMac in the classroom.\n",
    "  * **If you have access to TACC**:\n",
    "    * TACC is a supercomputer located somewhere at UT\n",
    "    * You should be able to perform necessary data processing for this course using TACC\n",
    "    * You should remote-login to TACC via your laptop or an iMac in the classroom.\n",
    "  * **If you have an awesome laptop with a fast CPU and plenty of RAM and disk space**:\n",
    "    * You may use your laptop for analyses for this course, but I do not recommend it.\n",
    "    * Some preprocessing steps may take hours, and you may have to leave your laptop running during that time.\n",
    "  * **If you are not a part of a brain imaging lab**:\n",
    "    * You may use an iMac in the classroom. \n",
    "    * Your codes and data will reside on that particular iMac. Thus you must log on to the same iMac every time you work on data analyses.\n",
    "    * It is possible to remote-log in to an iMac in the classroom, from another Mac, IF no one else is using the iMac at that moment. There is no way to guarantee this.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Storage\n",
    "Neuroimaging data are huge. Be prepare to store 50+GB of data somewhere (on your computer or on a network drive). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Software\n",
    "\n",
    "#### FSL or SPM\n",
    "You have to have either of these packages. If you have both, that's great!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### MATLAB\n",
    "If you choose to use SPM, you need MATLAB in addition. You should be able to get it free through UT. You need MATLAB to install SPM.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Python\n",
    "Version 3.5 or later. You can download Python free from various distributions.\n",
    "  * *IDLE* (https://www.python.org/downloads/)\n",
    "  * *Anaconda* (https://anaconda.org/anaconda/python)\n",
    "    * ***NB***: Anaconda Python may overwrite some libraries & programs on Mac\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Python libraries\n",
    "These are required libraries for Python. Make sure to install libraries for Python 3. \n",
    "  * NumPy\n",
    "  * SciPy\n",
    "  * Matplotlib\n",
    "  * Pandas\n",
    "  * NiBabel\n",
    "  * Nipype\n",
    "  \n",
    "If you have *Anaconda Python*, then some libraries are pre-installed (NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, and Pandas). Otherwise, you need to install these libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Installation check\n",
    "It is a good idea to check whether you already have the library you are interested. To do so, you can start Python and type the command\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import [library name]\n",
    "```\n",
    "where you replace `[library name]` with the name of the library you want to check.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Installing a library (non-Anaconda)\n",
    "I recommend updating **`pip`** by running the command on the command prompt:\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip3 install --upgrade pip\n",
    "```\n",
    "Then install a library by\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip3 install [library name]\n",
    "```\n",
    "where you replace `[library name]` with the name of the library you are trying to install.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Installing a library (Anaconda)\n",
    "Installing a library via **`pip`** is not recommended for *Anaconda python*. Instead, you can run\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda install -c conda-forge [library name]\n",
    "```\n",
    "where you replace `[library name]` with the name of the library you are trying to install.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Git\n",
    "**`Git`** enables you do clone (or copy) notes, codes, and some data associated with the class from the GitHub repository on the web. If you are using a Mac, then Git comes standard on Mac and you don't have to install it. If you are using a Linux or a Windows computer, you can download Git for free from its website (https://git-scm.com/downloads).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "Jupyter Notebook enables you to read course notes and run Python codes on your web browser. Jupyter Notebook comes standard on Anaconda. For any other Python environment, you can install it by\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip3 install jupyter\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Course Materials\n",
    "Notes and codes for this course are available on GitHub repositories. I will show you how to access these materials later today.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "I will try to use publicly available data sets as much as possible. If only a subset of a large data set is needed, I may upload the sub-data set on Box.com.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Grading\n",
    "### Homework Assignments (40%)\n",
    "There will be 5 HW assignments throughout the semester. Your grade will be determined by 4 highest scores among 5 assignments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mini-Hackathons (40%)\n",
    "There will be two mini-hackathons (20% each). Each mini-hackathon is a group project, where a team of 2-3 students work collectively on a given problem. More details will be provided as we get closer to a mini-hackathon.\n",
    "\n",
    "### In-Class Exercise Presentations (20+%)\n",
    "There are in-class exercises during each class. Some of such exercises, students can post their solutions on Canvas using the Discussion functionality. Among posted solutions, one student is selected to explain his / her answer to the entire class. By presenting a solution, students can earn:\n",
    "  * 5% -- 1st and 2nd presentations\n",
    "  * 4% -- 3rd, 4th, and 5th presentations\n",
    "  * 1% -- 6th and subsequent presentations\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Policies\n",
    "### Auditing\n",
    "*Please please ask for my permission before coming to the class!* The instructor reserves the right to revoke the permission when an auditor is disruptive to the class (e.g., asking many questions not directly related to the class, engaging in activities unrelated to the class).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Attendance\n",
    "Please make effort to attend mini-hackathons in person. The instructor doesn't keep track of attendance on regular basis, but if you are not in the class, you cannot earn points for in-class presentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Late Assignments\n",
    "Points will be taken off for late assignments. See the syllabus for details.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Group Submission\n",
    "Students may work together on a homework assignment. If students do work together, the\n",
    "students in the same group may submit an identical document. Each student is still responsible for submitting homework assignments individually on Canvas. When your homework assignment submission is part of a group submission, you must comment in your submission (either in the submission document itself or using the comment function in Canvas) whom you worked with. ***The group size may not exceed 3***.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Academic Integrity\n",
    "Do not cheat! ***The instructor will report any incident of academic misconduct***."

    "**`Git`** can keep track of codes and documents you use for a particular project. `Git` is similar to the *track change* functionality on Microsoft Word, except that it can keep track of multiple documents stored in the same directory. A directory kept track by `Git` is referred as a git repository. \n",
