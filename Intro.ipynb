    "  \n",
    "## What this course is about\n",
    "\n",
    "***In this course, you will learn more than how to press buttons on a particular analysis software tool.*** Instead, there will be lots of coding! It is becoming more common among neuroimaging researchers to code and construct their own pipeline to meet their particular data analysis needs. You will also learn concepts associated with various steps of preprocessing and analyses. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Required tools\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hardware\n",
    "#### Computer\n",
    "You will need a computer that can handle a typical fMRI study data for preprocessing and data analysis. I recommend a system with at least 4GB of RAM per CPU core.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **If your lab has a computer for fMRI data processing**:\n",
    "    * Great! You should remote-login to that computer via your laptop or an iMac in the classroom.\n",
    "  * **If you have access to TACC**:\n",
    "    * TACC is a supercomputer located somewhere at UT\n",
    "    * You should be able to perform necessary data processing for this course using TACC\n",
    "    * You should remote-login to TACC via your laptop or an iMac in the classroom.\n",
    "  * **If you have an awesome laptop with a fast CPU and plenty of RAM and disk space**:\n",
    "    * You may use your laptop for analyses for this course, but I do not recommend it.\n",
    "    * Some preprocessing steps may take hours, and you may have to leave your laptop running during that time.\n",
    "  * **If you are not a part of a brain imaging lab**:\n",
    "    * You may use an iMac in the classroom. \n",
    "    * Your codes and data will reside on that particular iMac. Thus you must log on to the same iMac every time you work on data analyses.\n",
    "    * It is possible to remote-log in to an iMac in the classroom, from another Mac, IF no one else is using the iMac at that moment. There is no way to guarantee this.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Storage\n",
    "Neuroimaging data are huge. Be prepare to store 50+GB of data somewhere (on your computer or on a network drive). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Software\n",
    "\n",
    "#### FSL or SPM\n",
    "You have to have either of these packages. If you have both, that's great!\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### MATLAB\n",
    "If you choose to use SPM, you need MATLAB in addition. You should be able to get it free through UT. You need MATLAB to install SPM.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Python\n",
    "Version 3.5 or later. You can download Python free from various distributions.\n",
    "  * *IDLE* (https://www.python.org/downloads/)\n",
    "  * *Anaconda* (https://anaconda.org/anaconda/python)\n",
    "    * ***NB***: Anaconda Python may overwrite some libraries & programs on Mac\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Python libraries\n",
    "These are required libraries for Python. Make sure to install libraries for Python 3. \n",
    "  * NumPy\n",
    "  * SciPy\n",
    "  * Matplotlib\n",

    "  * NiBabel\n",
    "  * Nipype\n",
    "  \n",
    "If you have *Anaconda Python*, then some libraries are pre-installed (NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, and Pandas). Otherwise, you need to install these libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Installation check\n",
    "It is a good idea to check whether you already have the library you are interested. To do so, you can start Python and type the command\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import [library name]\n",
    "```\n",
    "where you replace `[library name]` with the name of the library you want to check.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Installing a library (non-Anaconda)\n",
    "I recommend updating **`pip`** by running the command on the command prompt:\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip3 install --upgrade pip\n",
    "```\n",
    "Then install a library by\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip3 install [library name]\n",
    "```\n",
    "where you replace `[library name]` with the name of the library you are trying to install.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Installing a library (Anaconda)\n",
    "Installing a library via **`pip`** is not recommended for *Anaconda python*. Instead, you can run\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda install -c conda-forge [library name]\n",
    "```\n",
    "where you replace `[library name]` with the name of the library you are trying to install.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Git\n",
    "**`Git`** enables you do clone (or copy) notes, codes, and some data associated with the class from the GitHub repository on the web. If you are using a Mac, then Git comes standard on Mac and you don't have to install it. If you are using a Linux or a Windows computer, you can download Git for free from its website (https://git-scm.com/downloads).\n",

    "\n",
    "## Course Materials\n",
    "Notes and codes for this course are available on GitHub repositories. I will show you how to access these materials later today.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "I will try to use publicly available data sets as much as possible. If only a subset of a large data set is needed, I may upload the sub-data set on Box.com.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Grading\n",
    "### Homework Assignments (40%)\n",
    "There will be 5 HW assignments throughout the semester. Your grade will be determined by 4 highest scores among 5 assignments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mini-Hackathons (40%)\n",
    "There will be two mini-hackathons (20% each). Each mini-hackathon is a group project, where a team of 2-3 students work collectively on a given problem. More details will be provided as we get closer to a mini-hackathon.\n",
    "\n",
    "### In-Class Exercise Presentations (20+%)\n",
    "There are in-class exercises during each class. Some of such exercises, students can post their solutions on Canvas using the Discussion functionality. Among posted solutions, one student is selected to explain his / her answer to the entire class. By presenting a solution, students can earn:\n",
    "  * 5% -- 1st and 2nd presentations\n",
    "  * 4% -- 3rd, 4th, and 5th presentations\n",
    "  * 1% -- 6th and subsequent presentations\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Policies\n",
    "### Auditing\n",
    "*Please please ask for my permission before coming to the class!* The instructor reserves the right to revoke the permission when an auditor is disruptive to the class (e.g., asking many questions not directly related to the class, engaging in activities unrelated to the class).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Attendance\n",
    "Please make effort to attend mini-hackathons in person. The instructor doesn't keep track of attendance on regular basis, but if you are not in the class, you cannot earn points for in-class presentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Late Assignments\n",
    "Points will be taken off for late assignments. See the syllabus for details.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Group Submission\n",
    "Students may work together on a homework assignment. If students do work together, the\n",
    "students in the same group may submit an identical document. Each student is still responsible for submitting homework assignments individually on Canvas. When your homework assignment submission is part of a group submission, you must comment in your submission (either in the submission document itself or using the comment function in Canvas) whom you worked with. ***The group size may not exceed 3***.\n",

    "## What is Git?\n",
    "\n",
    "**`Git`** can keep track of codes and documents you use for a particular project. `Git` is similar to the *track change* functionality on Microsoft Word, except that it can keep track of multiple documents stored in the same directory. A directory kept track by `Git` is referred as a git repository. \n",
    "\n",
    "`Git` also facilitates sharing of codes and documents. Via an online repository called GitHub, one can copy and update git repositories created by others. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this course, I will post course materials as git repositories on GitHub, so that you can copy and update course materials (notes and codes) on your computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Crash course on Git\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal here is to show you how to **clone** (or copy) the course material git repositories from GitHub, and how to update them (as I continue to add new materials).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cloning a git repository\n",
    "  * **Mac users**: Please start the terminal app. \n",
    "  * **Linux users**: Please start a terminal.\n",
    "  * **Windows users**: Please start **`Git Bash`**, a part of the Git software package.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then please move to the location where you want to house git repositories. To see which directory you are in, you type the command\n",
    "```\n",
    "pwd\n",
    "```\n",
    "on your terminal. You may see something line **`/home/satoru`**. To move to another directory, you need to type the command **`cd`** followed by the directory name. Say, I want to move to the directory **`fMRI`**. Then you need to type\n",
    "```\n",
    "cd fMRI\n",
    "```\n",
    "You can verify the location by typing `pwd` command again. If you want to create a directory called `fMRI`, then you can create a directory by\n",
    "```\n",
    "mkdir fMRI\n",
    "```\n",
    "Then you can move to the newly created directory `fMRI`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now you are ready to clone git repositories. You can clone the git repository for course notes by\n",
    "```\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/sathayas/JupyterfMRIFall2018.git [Directory Name]\n",
    "```\n",
    "where `[Directory Name]` is the directory name of your choice (e.g., \"`Notes`\"). You can see the content of the cloned repository by\n",

    "ls -l [Directory Name]\n",
    "```\n",
    "You have successfully cloned my git repository for course notes!\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Updating a git repository\n",
    "As I mentioned, I will be adding new materials to my git repositories throughout the semester. That means the version of git repositories you cloned today may be out of date, without including any new materials. But you can **`pull`** (or synch) new materials from my master git repositories by a simple command. You need to move to the cloned git repository directory (e.g., `Notes` or `Codes`), then run the command\n",
    "```\n",
    "git pull\n",
    "```\n",
    "This command automatically pulls (or downloads) any changes and updates to your cloned git repository, so that your clone is up to date.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Updating a git repository (overwriting)\n",
    "If you are to modify a note or a code in a cloned git repository on your computer, ***I highly recommend saving the document under a different name***. This is to avoid discrepancies between my master git repositories and your cloned repositories. Say, you edit or modify some documents (notes or codes) in your local git repository, and save under the same file name. Then `Git` will likely give you an error when you try to pull. This is because there are two versions of the same document, and `Git` cannot decide which one you would like to keep.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you happen to modified some documents in your cloned repository, then here are the steps I suggest:\n",
    "1. Rename the modified documents, and save them somewhere other than your cloned git repository.\n",
    "2. Run the following commands\n",
    "```\n",
    "git reset --hard HEAD\n",
    "git pull\n",

    "## GitHub\n",
    "GitHub is a hosting service for git repositories, accessible by a web browser. Any project you store on GitHub is available as a repository on GitHub. Your repository has its own URL to facilitate the access. You can create an account on GitHub for free, if you don't have an account already. You can do so at GitHub's web site at https://github.com and sign up for an account.\n",
    "\n",
    "GitHub offers an easy way to share your codes with others. This can be beneficial if you are part of a collaborative project. Moreover, it can be used as a platform to disseminate your programs with the general public, or at least other researchers in your field.\n",
    "\n",
